# House Price Category Prediction (Machine Learning)
#  Project Overview

This project is a machine learning classification system that predicts the price category of a house (Low, Medium, High) based on multiple features such as:

House size
Number of bedrooms
House age
Parking availability
Location
Two classification algorithms are used:
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier

# Problem Statement

Predicting exact house prices can be difficult and noisy.
Instead, this project classifies houses into price ranges, which is more practical for many real-world applications like real estate listing platforms.
